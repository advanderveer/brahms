# Brahms
An implementation of [Brahms: Byzantine resilient random membership sampling](https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabik/publications/Brahms-COMNET.pdf). It describes a byzantine resilient gossip protocol that creates a well-connected overlay network with each member only needing to knowing at most `O(âˆ›n)` other peers.
